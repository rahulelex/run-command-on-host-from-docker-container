# README: Solutions for Running Commands from Docker Containers to Host

This document provides two different solutions for executing commands from a Docker container to interact with the host system.


## Solution 1: Using SSH to Run Commands from the Container to the Host

You can use SSH from inside the Docker container to remotely execute commands on the host system.

### Example Command

1. **Without Password Pipe:**
   ```bash
   ssh <username>@<ip-address-of-host> 'sudo -S service mosquitto status'
   ```
2. **With Password Pipe:**
   ```bash
   ssh <username>@<ip-address-of-host> 'echo pass1234 | sudo -S service mosquitto status'
   ```
In both cases, replace the following:

- \<username\>: The SSH username on the host.
- \<ip-address-of-host\>: The IP address of the host.
- pass1234: The password for the sudo command, if required (ensure it is replaced with your actual password).
Note: The SSH approach requires SSH access to be configured between the container and the host system. Ensure that your firewall settings and SSH configuration allow for this communication.

## Solution 2: Using chroot to Access the Host Filesystem from the Container
The **chroot** command allows the container to access the hostâ€™s filesystem by changing the root directory of the process to /host, which makes the container think it is running directly on the host filesystem.

**Steps to Use chroot:**
Run the Docker Container with chroot:

Use the following Docker command to start a container that mounts the host's filesystem and uses chroot to change the root directory:

```bash
docker run -ti --net=host --pid=host --ipc=host --volume /:/host ubuntu:22.04 chroot /host
```
This command does the following:

- --net=host: Shares the network namespace with the host.
- --pid=host: Shares the PID namespace with the host.
- --ipc=host: Shares the IPC namespace with the host.
- --volume /:/host: Mounts the host's root filesystem (/) to /host in the container.
- chroot /host: Changes the root directory for processes in the container to the host's filesystem, effectively giving the container direct access to the host system.
Running Host Commands from the Container:

Once inside the container, you can run any host command or access the host's filesystem as if you are directly on the host system.
